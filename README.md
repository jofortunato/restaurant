# Joao's House - Restaurant Page

## Current Status:

Under development.

## Motivation

Part of my journey learning to create web apps. This part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript course. This project in particular has the goal to create a page where each element is part of its own module - DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file.

## Development

### To-do:

- [ ] Create the navigation header;
- [ ] Setup the tab switching logic;
- [ ] Create the Homepage;
- [ ] Create the function to wipe out all content from the page;
- [ ] Create the About page;
- [ ] Create the Menu page;
- [ ] Create the Gallery page;
- [ ] Create the Contacts page.
